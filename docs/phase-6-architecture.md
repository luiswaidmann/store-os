# Phase 6 — Offer Architecture / Content Strategy / GTM Plan

## Status

**PLANNED — not yet implemented.**

Phase 5 (`build-strategy-synthesis`) is the current terminal phase.
Phase 6 extends the chain with three parallel synthesis phases that transform strategic intelligence into actionable build inputs.

## Node Contracts

### build-offer-architecture
```
Pattern: 5-node (Subworkflow Trigger → Validate Inputs → Build LLM Prompt → LLM Synthesis → Parse Validate Write)
Trigger: n8n-nodes-base.executeWorkflow (from orchestrate-phase1)
Input:   strategy_synthesis + brand_positioning + market_intelligence + runtime_config
Output:  offer_architecture (inline, cloud mode) | offer-architecture.json (self-hosted)
LLM:     gpt-4o-mini (dev) / gpt-4o (staging+)
Cloud:   fully compatible (inline output, no AJV)
```

### build-content-strategy
```
Pattern: 5-node
Trigger: n8n-nodes-base.executeWorkflow
Input:   strategy_synthesis + offer_architecture + brand_positioning + runtime_config
Output:  content_strategy (inline) | content-strategy.json (self-hosted)
Cloud:   fully compatible
```

### build-gtm-plan
```
Pattern: 5-node
Trigger: n8n-nodes-base.executeWorkflow
Input:   strategy_synthesis + offer_architecture + content_strategy + runtime_config
Output:  gtm_plan (inline) | gtm-plan.json (self-hosted)
Cloud:   fully compatible
Note:    Must run after both build-offer-architecture AND build-content-strategy
```

## Orchestrator Extension

When Phase 6 is implemented, `orchestrate-phase1` must be extended with:

```
Phase 5 Complete
    │
    ├── Prepare Offer Architecture Input
    │   └── Run build-offer-architecture
    │       └── Offer Architecture Success? → Phase 6a Complete | Halt
    │
    ├── Prepare Content Strategy Input (after 6a)
    │   └── Run build-content-strategy
    │       └── Content Strategy Success? → Phase 6b Complete | Halt
    │
    └── Prepare GTM Plan Input (after 6a + 6b)
        └── Run build-gtm-plan
            └── GTM Plan Success? → Phase 6 Complete | Halt
```

**Bridge nodes required:**
- `Prepare Offer Architecture Input` — assemble input from Phase 5 output
- `Prepare Content Strategy Input` — add offer_architecture to chain
- `Prepare GTM Plan Input` — add content_strategy to chain

**New `workflow-ids.json` entries needed:**
- `build-offer-architecture`
- `build-content-strategy`
- `build-gtm-plan`

---

## Phase 6 → Phase 7 Handoff

Phase 7 (Store Build) receives the combined output of Phase 6:

```json
{
  "strategy_synthesis":   "...",
  "offer_architecture":   "...",
  "content_strategy":     "...",
  "gtm_plan":             "...",
  "brand_positioning":    "...",
  "runtime_config":       "..."
}
```

Phase 7 uses this to drive:
- `build-design-system` — visual identity tokens
- `build-section-plan` — homepage + PDP section structure
- `build-product-content` — AI-generated product descriptions
- `build-page-content` — editorial pages (About, FAQ, Blog)
- `build-deployment-manifest` — Shopify theme deployment manifest

## Architecture Note: Artifact Forwarding Pattern

Subworkflows in store-os only return their immediate output artifact + runtime_config. They do NOT forward upstream artifacts. All Phase 6 bridge nodes must explicitly source upstream artifacts using `$node[...]` references:

| Bridge node | `offer_architecture` | `strategy_synthesis` | `brand_positioning` etc. |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Prepare Offer Architecture Input` | — | — | `$node['Prepare Strategy Synthesis Input']` |
| `Prepare Content Strategy Input` | `$node['Phase 6a Complete']` | `$node['Phase 5 Complete']` | `$node['Prepare Strategy Synthesis Input']` |
| `Prepare GTM Plan Input` (planned) | `$node['Phase 6a Complete']` | `$node['Phase 5 Complete']` | `$node['Prepare Strategy Synthesis Input']` + `$node['Phase 6b Complete']` for `content_strategy` |
